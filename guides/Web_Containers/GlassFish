Sun Microsystem had a plan to open source its application server and that plan was implemented through Project GlassFish, which was announced at JavaOne 2005. Initially Sun and Oracle Corporation became the main source code donors for this project. As a result of this effort, we have a freely available, open source, Java EE-compatible application server that is quickly growing in popularity.

GlassFish is an Application Server which can also be used as a Web Server(Http Server). A web Server involves handling HTTP requests (usually from browsers). It is different from the popular software Apache Tomcat which is a Servlet Container meaning that it can handle servlets & JSP code. An Application Server GlassFish in this case means that it can manage Java EE applications, usually both servlet/JavaServerPages(JSP) and EJBs(Enterprise JavaBeans). You can use GlassFish for efficient Java EE enterprise applications.

Glassfish can be utilized under the the folowing licenses a. Common Development & Distribution(CCDL) 
b. GNU General public license(GPL)
